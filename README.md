# Attention-CNN-Intrusion-Detection-System
A potential network intrusion detection algorithm is proposed, introducing a multiplicative attention mechanism and integrating it into the CNN classification model. This provides a novel approach to improving the accuracy of network intrusion detection. I will provide a detailed description of the model's structure and related code.
